# Movie_Recommender_System_ByRating

A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system which challenges to assume the priorities of a user, and make recommendations on the basis of userâ€™s priorities. Recommendation systems help users find and select items (e.g., books, movies, restaurants) from the huge number available on the web or in other electronic information sources.

Here we are using Collaborative Filtering, where in we try to cluster alike users together and use data about the group to make recommendations to the customer. Collaborative Filtering techniques make recommendations for a user based on ratings and preferences data of many users. The main underlying idea is that if two users have both liked certain common items, then the items that one user has liked that the other user has not yet tried can be recommended to him. We see collaborative filtering techniques in action on various Internet platforms such as Amazon.com, Netflix, Facebook. We are recommended items based on the ratings and purchase data that these platforms collect from their user base.
